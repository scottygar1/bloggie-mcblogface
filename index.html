      <p>3 months. Oops. Must get better at keeping this up to date.</p>
<p>So, a brief overview, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>KTB is still in the middle of nowhere. Nobody’s quite sure why or how it’s supposed to work, but we plough on. With nothing</li>
<li>PQQ is finally getting tested. Seems to be reasonably stable with 1 small issue</li>
<li>1FA has been and gone. What a whirlwind that was - with some huge challenges</li>
<li>Release candidate: Me</li>
<li>I’m now a certified scrum master</li>
</ul>
<p>Stretched, pulled, hired and fired have been the themes of the last three months.</p>
<p>Every project is priority. We all know how that ends. KTB are still extremely slow with their analysis, which means they’re still not ready for the things they think they want. New engines and frameworks are all in place and ready to go, they just need to be filled with content - meaning decisions need to be made. Experian came and went, as they realised that another potential option was blown out of the water by not know what we wanted and how we wanted it. Still, some great exposure to other areas of the business.</p>
<p>PQQ seems relatively smooth so far, given the speed they wanted everything and the huge complexities of the connections. Looks like a bug exists in the error handling, but it seems to come from the shared libs - so it could be a nightmare. Work to do.</p>
<p>1FA has been the most challenging project I’ve worked on so far. 3 Tibco Devs committing to the same branches is not a fun thing. The stakeholder management opportunities have been extreme. Picking up the work of another who was - well, poor at his job and communicating with others - has made me realise how valuable an asset I am. As recognised by KB, who made her feedback clear enough.</p>
<p>I have also picked up the release process through SIT. Which is more of a challenge than it seems. Teaching the new guys my Git learnings has also shown me that I have picked up a lot of stuff in 18 months. Going from not having used git to being utilised for my knowledge of git is a great example of me doing what I do best #knowledgesponge.</p>
<p>This week, I also qualified as a Scrum Master. And I can now genuinely judge how bad we are at Agile methodologies and practices.</p>
<p><strong>Seriously. Bad.</strong></p>
<p>Now to move towards talks of a proper job - challenged by SB as “he’s doing all the legwork for me”.</p>

      <p>It’s been 2 months. It’s been a long 2 months.</p>
<ul>
<li>PQQ Service dev complete</li>
<li>2020 stalled</li>
<li>Jenkinsfile is a pain in the arse</li>
<li>Gradle is worse</li>
<li>New nexus doesn’t work as planned</li>
</ul>
<p>A long 2 months, but somewhat productive. I’ve been stretched a bit by getting involved with the PQQ service. WS Security proved to be a nightmare beyond belief, which was fixed by DM reverting to one of my earlier builds - Though I was informed this wasn’t good enough at the time..</p>
<p>2020 is still messy. Decisions are.. lacking or being overruled by a greater being, somewhere in the ether. I’ve decided to press on with my micro-services idea, though I think it’ll be shelved by DP. I don’t think new things make him tick.</p>
<p>All the while, I’ve been playing with Jenkins and trying to get the new version to play nice with Tibco. It hasn’t, yet.<br>So I thought I’d try pulling the build into gradle, rather than maven.</p>
<p>It still hasn’t.</p>
<p>New nexus upgrades have also taken place at the same time - which will be a great task of updating all the pointers to the new nexus at some stage. There are many.</p>
<p>Learnings: I have a better idea about how things work than I thought I did. However, the way it is done is messy and even messier to unpick. <strong>Don’t run old builds on a stable environment.</strong> It overwrites stuff.</p>

      <p>If the last month was slow, this one has flown by.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprint -2 and Sprint -1 complete.</li>
<li>Framework Upgrades in place for 2020 kicking off.</li>
<li>Tibco and Cucumber do not mix.</li>
<li>Debauchery, lies and hidden truths.</li>
</ul>
<p>So scrap last month’s update. It was full of positivity and seeing the best in all things people related. That’s gone drastically downhill since then, as I have realised that things getting discussed at standup aren’t actually the full truth. Nobody has control of the overall endgame. It’s a power struggle with lots of people competing against each other in full blown silos. </p>
<p>Bigger silos than I’ve ever seen before.</p>
<p>On the plus side, it’s meant I’ve had plenty of time to focus on the Tibco stack, my own knowledge improving daily, and trying to integrate other functionality and systems with the current stack we have. Cucumber looks like a delightful thing, but it’ll mean SOAP to JSON conversions and manually building the payloads. </p>
<p>Nobody wants that. It’ll be a pain in the arse to keep up to date.</p>
<p>Learnings: Though it may be possible, teamwork and breaking down silos isn’t easy. <strong>People do not like change.</strong></p>

      <p>2020 KTB is complete. It’s been a long month.</p>
<ul>
<li>Holiday passed far too quick.</li>
<li>All Tibco 2020 work promoted to MDev &amp; working.</li>
<li>SM VB dev completed.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been a busy month, full of teamwork from many different areas. 2020 has been completed, with a few hitches along the way - but we’re in and working. It’s been an experience with many ups and downs - from starting off with little knowledge of anything that’s going on and finding it hard to get any information, to seeing that it’s a project with several really promising ideas - and knowing how all the parts fit together.</p>
<p>It’s quite compelling seeing so many different areas in a standup together and talking/working as a team.</p>
<p>Speaking of working as a team, I feel like the Tibco team are working better together - It feels less broken. SL is starting to come out of her shell, and switching projects has given us a chance to appreciate what the others do. DM did some cool stuff with 2020 while I was away and it was nice to be able to come back and understand/add into what was done.</p>
<p>As a side note/project, I’ve completed a relatively small, but important piece of VBA for the SM team. It’ll reduce workload and a real pain point for managers completing the forms that are required. Hopefully.</p>
<p>Risk have also asked me to pop in and talk to them about agile. Something I need to prepare for, as I’m by no means an expert. It’ll be a good stretch for me to try to get them to take some of the stuff we do on-board. Standups as a first measure.</p>
<p>Learnings: Teamwork &amp; non-silos across the business <strong>are</strong> possible. It might just take a while.</p>

      <p>So a month has passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
<ul>
<li>2020 has commenced in service layer. With a bang.<ul>
<li>I am the sole Tibco dev.</li>
<li>Full development of all services required.</li>
<li>Integration of services with new tools.</li>
<li>Tunnels within tunnels within tunnels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last 4 weeks has been a crazy blur. 2020 has taken over my life, caused me more political nightmares than I ever knew were possible and proved to me that I have a lot of skill with the tools I’m working with.</p>
<p>My service layer is almost complete, built from scratch with very little help - this is my first large scale display of what I have achieved over the last year. And I have the small plus of people referring to me as the lead Tibco dev on the project. That felt good.</p>
<p>The new tools are both great and horrific in the same breath. They do some awesome things but can be horrible to talk to and get information from. I did enjoy being able to go back and make requests of other people though, made me feel like I’m gaining credibility with the other devs.</p>
<p>Tunnelling is my new favourite past-time. Or at least you’d think it is. It’s been a huge challenge to get my head around where I need to tunnel to and how tunnels even work. </p>
<p>My record so far is 9 tunnels at once. It’s not something I’m proud of.</p>
<p>Learnings: <strong>Don’t be afraid to put yourself forward and ask the difficult questions.</strong> DP has proved that it can actually be very beneficial and people have listened to the request and given us a lot of information.</p>

      <p>It’s been a long, slow couple of weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit Limit is essentially finished.</li>
<li>First solo standup.</li>
<li>Values award nomination.</li>
<li>C2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>Credit Limit has been less of a challenge than I thought it would be (so far). I think I’ve learned more than I give myself credit for over the last 10 months.</p>
<p>It’s not really an achievement, but I held my first mobile standup this week. It’s interesting to see that JJ is happy to give me that role before others who have been in the team longer.</p>
<p>DT arrived at my desk today and said that he’s putting me forward for a values award, which is awesome. Turns out that putting that much effort into getting to the hackathon was not only worth it, but seen from a distance as well.</p>
<p>C2020 looks interesting. Last week was dipping my toes in the water and this week should see us start to get involved in the detail. It could be a huge project with a lot of work, or it could be a huge problem with a lot of work. Dependent on where the business decides to take it and the key architecture that’s implemented.</p>
<p>It’s going to be an interesting journey either way.</p>
<p>Also.. Pokemon go is ruining my life. But I love it.</p>

      <p>Douglas has returned!<br>Not that there was much issue whilst he was off:</p>
<ul>
<li>GI successful deployment.</li>
<li>Loans had one issue, which I found in the logs and pointed them in the right direction (not me!)</li>
<li>PCA we don’t talk about, as they don’t know what they want. Twice.</li>
<li>SSCA is an absolute monster, but I’m getting there. Slowly.</li>
<li>Hackathon.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, a very successful couple of weeks. I have started creating the all important network that, until now, I had been shielded from. People have been coming to me with questions and I’ve been finding that I can answer them. Which I didn’t necessarily expect.</p>
<p>And then the two weeks were capped off with the Hackathon. A great trip for Me, John, Mitesh, Megan and Jacob. First Hackathon, first podium finish. The idea of a garbage saver went down a treat, hooked into that all important loyalty system. Great feedback from the CTO, and I’m now intrigued to see if they take it on and make it happen.<br>Might pop the champagne cork winnings later..</p>
<p>Learnings: I need to have more confidence in myself. The two times I asked for help, I got a terrible answer that I didn’t question. <strong>Must. Question. More.</strong></p>
<p>Oh, yeh.. and Pokemon go. It will ruin my life.</p>

      <p>This week has been a fruitful, if extremely long week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Factory 1 config is nearing completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, that’s all I’ve done. All week. From start to finish. Monday to Friday. ALL WEEK!</p>
<p>Learnings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying a factory instance is not as easy as it sounds. (Don’t try it again - and if you do, be aware that there’s a lot of stuff you need to re-configure).</li>
<li>Jenkins allows for configurable builds, and you can carry variables through those builds for deployment purposes.</li>
<li>The original SOAP tests that I wrote on my first service were awful, and I need to re-do them.</li>
<li>SOAP has an option to add the same endpoint to all services, meaning I will waste no further time typing it in manually.</li>
<li>If you’re in the admin console, your build will not deploy.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, it’s been a good week for learning. I now know what the build scripts actually do (and where they are failing silently), so I can go and amend them over the next couple of weeks. I really need to get to grips with Datagrid and deployments to SIT before Douglas goes away though.</p>

      <p>The learning curve continues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean setup and config of new Continuous Integration Server (Factory1).</li>
<li>Loans service completed.</li>
<li>Update Money Transfer code.</li>
<li>Demo of JSON parsing for the rest of the team.</li>
<li>Learning deployment processes for when Douglas is away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Factory 1 setup has been an absolute beast. (Though I did spend a long time looking at port config, which has been resolved by the VPN I knew nothing about..). The re-config of Tibco machines and Jenkins integration is still being a pest, but I’m getting there.</p>
<p>Loans was a different challenge, but one that went really well. I feel like I’m getting a broader knowledge of the business as a whole.</p>
<p>JSON parse demo went really well -<br>The others gave me some food for thought and some tweaks I could make.</p>
<p>Deployment processes seem…. interesting. There’s a lot of paperwork, and I need the full end to end process documented before Douglas leaves.</p>
<p>In other news, CB didn’t like my App idea that I submitted, so some thinking to do before next year.</p>

      <p>This week has been a learning curve of sorts.</p>
<ul>
<li>JSON handling PoC completed and stored for future use.</li>
<li>RESTful service PoC completed for PCU and stored for future use.</li>
<li>IA completed for a new loans service.</li>
<li>IA completed for PCAO.</li>
</ul>
<p>IAs are not the easiest thing in the world - Basically trying to step through all the changes you need to make without actually completing them, and trying to foresee any issues this may cause.</p>
<p>The JSON handling is in a state where it works, as long as the order is specified - which isn’t really what JSON is about, so some refactoring to do there. (Or the potential purchase of a plugin to make it easier).</p>
<p>RESTful service is completed and ready to use / be adapted for future use in other projects - I think this will happen if we promote the fact that we can do it.</p>
<p>Now for holiday - Bring on Portugal.</p>
