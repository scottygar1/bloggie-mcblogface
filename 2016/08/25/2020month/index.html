<ul>
<li>2020 has commenced in service layer. With a bang.<ul>
<li>I am the sole Tibco dev.</li>
<li>Full development of all services required.</li>
<li>Integration of services with new tools.</li>
<li>Tunnels within tunnels within tunnels.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>The last 4 weeks has been a crazy blur. 2020 has taken over my life, caused me more political nightmares than I ever knew were possible and proved to me that I have a lot of skill with the tools I’m working with.</p>
<p>My service layer is almost complete, built from scratch with very little help - this is my first large scale display of what I have achieved over the last year. And I have the small plus of people referring to me as the lead Tibco dev on the project. That felt good.</p>
<p>The new tools are both great and horrific in the same breath. They do some awesome things but can be horrible to talk to and get information from. I did enjoy being able to go back and make requests of other people though, made me feel like I’m gaining credibility with the other devs.</p>
<p>Tunnelling is my new favourite past-time. Or at least you’d think it is. It’s been a huge challenge to get my head around where I need to tunnel to and how tunnels even work. </p>
<p>My record so far is 9 tunnels at once. It’s not something I’m proud of.</p>
<p>Learnings: <strong>Don’t be afraid to put yourself forward and ask the difficult questions.</strong> DP has proved that it can actually be very beneficial and people have listened to the request and given us a lot of information.</p>
