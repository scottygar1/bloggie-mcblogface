      <p>Douglas has returned!<br>Not that there was much issue whilst he was off:</p>
<ul>
<li>GI successful deployment.</li>
<li>Loans had one issue, which I found in the logs and pointed them in the right direction (not me!)</li>
<li>PCA we don’t talk about, as they don’t know what they want. Twice.</li>
<li>SSCA is an absolute monster, but I’m getting there. Slowly.</li>
<li>Hackathon.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, a very successful couple of weeks. I have started creating the all important network that, until now, I had been shielded from. People have been coming to me with questions and I’ve been finding that I can answer them. Which I didn’t necessarily expect.</p>
<p>And then the two weeks were capped off with the Hackathon. A great trip for Me, John, Mitesh, Megan and Jacob. First Hackathon, first podium finish. The idea of a garbage saver went down a treat, hooked into that all important loyalty system. Great feedback from the CTO, and I’m now intrigued to see if they take it on and make it happen.<br>Might pop the champagne cork winnings later..</p>
<p>Learnings: I need to have more confidence in myself. The two times I asked for help, I got a terrible answer that I didn’t question. <strong>Must. Question. More.</strong></p>
<p>Oh, yeh.. and Pokemon go. It will ruin my life.</p>
